# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I used Flask to create dynamic-responsive website that is based on flask routes.
With SQL i created three tables: books, readers and reviews. I imported my data base in file: import.py.
I created functions for registering the user, logging in, logging out(with use of session). Searcg function was the biggest challange to implement but in the end I was able to do it.
I created my own API, so you can see json file with detail about the book with changing url route.
I used render_template to connect back end with front end; inside html files I made use od Jinja2.
During the whole project I ran many tests to fix milions of bags.

That's that.
